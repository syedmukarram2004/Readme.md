This guide focuses on setting up your Kali Linux environment to run the Python reconnaissance tool, assuming you have a basic Kali installation.

Open a Terminal:

Click on the terminal icon in your Kali desktop environment.
Update Your System (Good Practice):

Before installing new tools, ensure your Kali system is up to date.
Bash

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
Install Python3 and pip (if not already installed):

Kali usually comes with Python 3 and pip (Python's package installer) pre-installed. You can verify with:
Bash

python3 --version
pip3 --version
If pip3 is missing, install it:
Bash

sudo apt install python3-pip -y
Install Nmap (Crucial for port_scan.py):

Your port_scan.py now uses the python-nmap library, which requires Nmap itself to be installed on your system. Kali usually has Nmap pre-installed, but confirm:
Bash

nmap --version
If Nmap is missing:
Bash

sudo apt install nmap -y
Extract Your Recon Tool:

Assuming you've transferred recon_tool.zip to your Kali machine (e.g., in your Downloads folder or Home directory):
Bash

unzip recon_tool.zip
cd recon_tool
Note: If you manually created the files on Kali, you can skip this step and just navigate to the recon_tool directory you created.
Install Python Dependencies:

Navigate into the recon_tool directory (if you're not already there):
Bash

cd recon_tool
Install all required Python libraries using pip:
Bash

pip3 install -r requirements.txt
Troubleshooting: If you encounter errors, especially with scapy or python-nmap, ensure you have the necessary system-level development libraries. Sometimes, installing python3-dev or similar packages helps.
Bash

sudo apt install python3-dev libnmap-dev -y # libnmap-dev might be needed for python-nmap
Then try pip3 install -r requirements.txt again.
Run the Tool:

Now you can execute your reconnaissance tool from the recon_tool directory. Replace example.com with your target domain.
Bash

python3 main.py example.com --whois --dns --subdomains --active --ports --dirs --vulns
You can choose which flags to use based on the type of reconnaissance you want to perform. For example, to only do WHOIS and DNS:
Bash

python3 main.py example.com --whois --dns
This comprehensive guide should help you get your enhanced reconnaissance tool up and running on Kali Linux for your penetration testing activities!
