## Features

* **Passive Reconnaissance**:
    * WHOIS lookup
    * DNS enumeration (A, MX, TXT, NS records)
    * Subdomain enumeration using external APIs (e.g., crt.sh, AlienVault OTX)
* **Active Reconnaissance**:
    * Port scanning (via Nmap wrapper or sockets)
    * Banner grabbing
    * Detecting technologies (e.g., using Wappalyzer CLI)
* **Reporting**:
    * Generate summary reports in `.txt` or `.html` format.
    * Include timestamps and IP resolution details.
* **Modularity**:
    * Each reconnaissance module is independent and callable via command-line flags.
    * Implemented logging with verbosity levels for detailed output.

## Installation

To set up the reconnaissance tool, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/recon-tool.git](https://github.com/your-username/recon-tool.git) # Replace with your actual repo URL
cd recon-tool
2. Install Python Dependencies
Install all necessary Python packages listed in requirements.txt:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
3. (Optional) Install Wappalyzer CLI
For enhanced and more accurate technology detection, it is highly recommended to install the Wappalyzer command-line interface globally. This requires Node.js and npm to be installed on your system.

Bash

npm install -g wappalyzer
Configuration
Before running the tool, you need to configure any external API keys or specific tool settings. This is done in the config/sources.yaml file (or config.py if using a .py based config).

Example config/sources.yaml (if used):

YAML

# config/sources.yaml
api_keys:
  alienvault_otx: "YOUR_ALIENVAULT_OTX_API_KEY"
  virustotal: "YOUR_VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY"
  # Add other API keys here as needed
Usage
Run the tool from the main directory by specifying the target domain and the desired reconnaissance options using command-line flags.

Bash

python3 main.py example.com --whois --dns --subdomains --ports --tech --wappa -vv
Available Flags
Flag	Description
--whois	Perform WHOIS lookup for the target domain.
--dns	Perform DNS enumeration for A, MX, TXT, and NS records.
--subdomains	Discover subdomains using configured external APIs (e.g., crt.sh).
--active	Execute all active reconnaissance modules.
--ports	Perform port scanning on the target (requires Nmap installed).
--banner	Perform banner grabbing on open ports (requires --ports).
--tech	Perform basic technology detection on discovered web services.
--wappa	Perform enhanced technology detection using the Wappalyzer CLI.
--dirs	Perform directory enumeration.
--vulns	Perform vulnerability scanning.
--vt	Query VirusTotal for domain reputation.
--report	Generate a summary report with all gathered information.
--report-format	Specify report format: txt (default) or html.
-v, -vv	Increase verbosity level: -v for INFO, -vv for DEBUG.

Future Improvements
We plan to continuously improve this tool with the following enhancements:

Asynchronous Scanning: Implement asynchronous operations to significantly improve scanning performance and reduce overall runtime.
Advanced Fingerprinting: Integrate more sophisticated fingerprinting techniques and heuristic analysis for highly accurate technology detection.
User Interface: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) or a web dashboard for a more intuitive user experience and enhanced reporting visualization.
Robust Error Handling: Enhance error handling mechanisms with automated retries and intelligent fallback strategies for network operations and API calls.
Continuous Monitoring: Automate periodic scanning and integrate the tool with CI/CD pipelines for continuous security monitoring capabilities.
Dockerization: Provide a Docker image for easy deployment across various environments.
